MYSQL:
It's the Structured Query Language for dealing with relational databases. SQL is used to insert, search, update, and delete database records.
SELECT: The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
SELECT * FROM  customer;------>table_name       
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
The SELECT DISTINCT statement:
It is used to return only distinct (different) values. Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values, and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...FROM table_name;
select  count( distinct customer_id )from orders ;
WHERE:
The WHERE clause is used to filter records. It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
Note: The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, but it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.!
select *from  orders where customer_id=4;
  
And (or)OR (or) NOT operations:
The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.
SELECT column1, column2, ...FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;
  example:select *from  customers where age=22 and country='UK';
  
The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;

The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.
SELECT column1, column2, ...FROM table_name
WHERE NOT condition;
  example: select *from  customers where not country='UK';(uk unde coulmn kakunda remaining motham vastai)
The MySQL ORDER BY Keyword:assending order and decending order
The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.
The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
 INSERT INTO:The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.
IS NULL Syntax:
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;
IS NOT NULL Syntax:
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
